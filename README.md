Idris to GAP back end
---------------------

Inspired by Edwin Brady's excellent [PHP backend](https://github.com/edwinb/idris/php) for
his even more excellent language [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org).

This Idris code to [GAP](https://github.com/gap-system/gap) code at the moment. I might add
direct compilation to GAP kernel code.
